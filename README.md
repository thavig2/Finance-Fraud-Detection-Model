# Finance Fraud Detection Model

The results from the classification report showed that all models performed
similarly with logistic regression with accuracy at 95.47%, decision tree with accuracy at
95.39%, and Naive-Bayes with accuracy at 94.99%. However, I believe the model with the best
performance was logistic regression because it had the highest precision at 95.11% and recall at
95.47%.
